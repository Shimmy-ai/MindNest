I don’t follow the crowd. I walk my own path.
Silence is my weapon; action is my language.
I don’t compete with anyone; I compete with myself.
I value freedom over popularity.
Strength is not shown in words, but in deeds.
I don’t explain myself. I just exist and let the world catch up.
Lone wolves aren’t lonely—they’re selective.
I answer to no one but my own standards.
The less I say, the more they wonder.
I don’t chase success. I let it chase me.
